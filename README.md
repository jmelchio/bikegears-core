# README

This is an old project that I've used in the past to experiment with Spring Web MVC. What you see here is the business logic split off of the monolith. Not sure if I'll work on this any time soon. Moved it from `Bitbucket` because `Mercurial` is going out of support by June 2020 and moving it here is the easiest way to convert it.

Will update the `Readme` if there is more to say about this.
